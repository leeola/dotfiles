# Send prefix!
#
# The send prefix is the command used to pass the prefix command through to
# inner windows. Primarily useful for when i am SSH'd into Koding and need to
# pass commands in. Ctrl-S might be a bad choice, we'll see, but i want it to
# be close to the main prefix key. Normally you would use the same prefix key
# but i have chosen prefix-prefix to mean toggle recent window thing.
# This is a bit of a mindfuck, so it's worth noting.

# These two allow me to easily detach all other clients, which happens quite
# a bit on Koding since a connection loss can result in a GNU Screen floating
# around for quite a while.
