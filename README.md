# Lee's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many dotfiles like them, but these are mine.


##  Installation

A preinstalled Node is required to install this.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `./install.coffee`
3. That's it!


## Destructive and Dumb

This is a *destructive and dumb* installation. It doesn't attempt to install
missing components, it will install everything every time. If you're files
are in the way, say goodbye to them. You have been warned.

If a file/directory is in the way, it will be moved to
`/tmp/dotfiletrash/DATETIME`. So, if you're missing something that you didn't
expect to be removed, check there. Otherwise, you have already been warned.
