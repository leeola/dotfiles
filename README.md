These are my dotfiles. There are many dotfiles like them, but these are
mine.

## under construction

My dotfiles are being revamped and moved. ./dotfiles contains the old
format dotfiles, where as the main repo now contains the new dotfiles.
The main difference being that previously i was using symlinks, and now
i'm using a bare repo in my home directory with the working directory
set as the home directory. Above all, this is simple! Stark contrast
to my old "dotfiles as an OS", ya?
