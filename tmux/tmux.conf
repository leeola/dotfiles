# Send prefix!
#
# The send prefix is the command used to pass the prefix command through to
# inner windows. Primarily useful for when i am SSH'd into Koding and need to
# pass commands in. Ctrl-S might be a bad choice, we'll see, but i want it to
# be close to the main prefix key. Normally you would use the same prefix key
# but i have chosen prefix-prefix to mean toggle recent window thing.
# This is a bit of a mindfuck, so it's worth noting.

# Easily navigate to the last window it C-a C-a
bind C-a last-window

# Show pane numbers and switch to the given pain.
# Key choice made because Ctrl-a q is more difficult than Ctrl-a Ctrl-e, imo.
